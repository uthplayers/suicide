	<h2>Suicide is when someone decides to take their one life. Because they just can't handle being alive no more.</h2>
<section>
	<p>
	was there ever that time in your live when you felt like everything is falling apart, you lost hope because absolutely nothing is going right in your life. The only thing that is keeping you going are the thoughts that maybe tomorrow will be a better day, after all there is always a next time. Most people that commit suicide are people feeling worthless or unappreciated although it not entirely their fault, they feel like they are not enough, they feel  too weak for this world, trapped and just trying to find a way out of the misery they are in and almost 90 percent of the people who suicide end up committing suicide. Every 40 seconds that passes one person decide to end their own life, yet we keep telling ourselves it a big world thing happen people die well have we thought that that person that decides to end their one life could be someone we know someone close to us someone we don’t want to lose. Sad how we don’t realize how important someone is to us until they are gone, the feeling of guilt never goes away you can't help but feel there is something you could have done.

			Yes, I am trying to make a point. When we make people feel unappreciated or hurt someone simply by using words, we are pushing them to the edge of having suicidal thoughts rather than helping them. Different things lead to suicidal thoughts which eventually may lead to suicidal.

		<ul>
			<Li>Sadness: while sadness is a normal thing that everyone experiences but when it left for long period of time is leads to depression which may then lead to suicide.<li></li>

<LI>Loss of a loved one: Greiving can be a painful thing even after a while the feeling never really goes away and you just can't get over it so you keep telling yourself things like maybe it should have been me, it all my fault</LI> 

<li>Depression:</li> 
<li>Stress:</LI>

<li>Feeling worthless or rejected:</li>

			As I come to the end of my speech, I would like to elucidate different way in which suicide can be prevented or you can stop yourself from coming suicide 

Start listening instead of judging and jumping to conclusions about people, you don’t know what going through and you never really can or never really will because we are not mind readers, but understanding is one of the best attributes someone can have. 

Live is not a movie don’t end it, even when in the darkest time there is always that glimmer of hope, you pain isn't permanent but what you do is. 

Remember whether you strong isn't determined by the situation you are in it determined by your ability to survive, while you may feel alone you are not alone all you need to do is look and you will find friendship and love in each other.Thanks for listening good bye.
